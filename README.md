## Our Aging Engineer Workforce

Our company is aging rapidly. Overall, we have approximately 65 thousand employees born between 1952 and 1955. Over half of those employees (33 thousand) are in Engineering, ranging from Assistant all the way to Senior Engineer. They are overdue to retire and I am surprised they haven't retired already. It is imperative that we replace these employees as effectively as possible in the next few years.

Pewlett-Hackard has a very limited mentorship program. Employees who born in 1965 are eligible for this program. That totals to about 3,100 employees. We believe we should increase the eligibility for mentorship in order to effectively replace our aging workforce.
